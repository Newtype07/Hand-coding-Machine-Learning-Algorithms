# Hand-coded-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Implement machine learning algorithms while trying my best to **avoid the usage of machine learning libaries** such as `sklearn`, only use `numpy`, `scipy`

**Contents**
- Linear Algebra: Gaussian Elimination and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
- K-means: sklearn was used to plot the Elbow method, which is optional
- Polynomial Regression Using Gradient Descent
- GMM: sklearn was used to initialize parameters for simplicity, **actually I can use the hand-made K-means**, or just use a set of randomly initialized parameters
- PCA of **High Dementional Data**

**Note**: encapsulation needed and will be done in the future
